# swagger-lambda-controller
Swagger Lambda Controller was built as an alternative solution to AWS API Gateway's lambda invokation. It was built for NodeJS Express applications that use Swagger and the swagger-tools middleware.  Define your lambda arn in your swagger route definition, and the Swagger Lambda Controller proxies/validates your request to the specified lambda function.
